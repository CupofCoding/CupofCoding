- 🐒 Hi, I’m anne@CupofCoding

I'm aiming to become an experienced developer, business system or solutions analyst. The design process has always been enjoyable for me. I prioritize quality of life and efficiency in order to come up with innovative solutions.
 
I believe balance between functionality and aesthetics is necessary for a pleasant user experience.

Self-taught programmer enrolled in a MERN fullstack bootcamp. Looking to further my career and gain industry experience.
